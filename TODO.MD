# Things that should be done in this project

This file contains the tasks and things that need to be done during development. It will partially serve the purpose of a backlog, and partially as a log for what is done and still needs to be done.


---

## Data preparation
    
- [x] Decide on and create a file-structure that will be used for the project
- [X] Decide on and implement a naming convention for the trajectories


### **Porto**

- [x] Ensure data are within bounded rectangle
- [x] Ensure that traces holds a minimum length
- [x] Ensure traces with invalid data points are removed
- [x] Abiltiy to write trajectories to files and to clear old files


### **Rome**

- [x] Concatenate the traces from one row per point to one row with a list of points
- [x] Ensure data are within bounded rectangle
- [x] Ensure all traces hold the minimum length
- [x] Remove traces with invalid data points
- [x] Abiltiy to write trajectories to files and to clear old files when refreshing data set

### Common

- [x] Split datasets using meta-files (100 - 200 - ... - 1000)
- [x] Added support for the creation of a smaller test-set of a given size
- [ ] Create and develop statistics methods over the datasets
- [ ] Gather statistics for the two datasets

## Development


### Utilities-functions

- [x] Alphabetical incrementer for naming trajectory files
- [x] File handler for reading trajectories
- [x] Meta file handler for retrieving the datasets
- [x] Distance function for the computation of distance beween any two coordinates

### Scheme creation

- [] Add a common interface with a minimum number of functionality that both schemes should implement

**Grid shemes**
- [] Some task


**Disk schemes**
- [] Some task
