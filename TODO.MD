## Data preparation
    
- [x] Decide on and create a file-structure that will be used for the project
- [X] Decide on and implement a naming convention for the trajectories


### **Porto**

- [x] Ensure data are within bounded rectangle
- [x] Ensure that traces holds a minimum length
- [] Ensure traces with invalid data points are removed
- [x] Abiltiy to write trajectories to files and to clear old files


### **Rome**

- [x] Concatenate the traces from one row per point to one row with a list of points
- [x] Ensure data are within bounded rectangle
- [x] Ensure all traces hold the minimum length
- [] Remove traces with invalid data points
- [x] Abiltiy to write trajectories to files and to clear old files when refreshin data set

### Common

- [] Split datasets using meta-files (100 - 200 - ... - 1000)
