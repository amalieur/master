In this folder we have several folders containing the results from the different experiments. One folder for each subset/experiment, each containing a folder for the resulting plots and a folder for the resulting csv-files.

The numbers of matches and no-matches inside a subsets folder, do not correspond. This means that a match-0.csv (in lists folder) is not necessarily the same as match-0.html (in plots folder).
